Advanced Physical Design - OpenLANE Workshop

## About this project  
OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault, OpenPhySyn, SPEF-Extractor and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization. It is a tool started for true open source tape-out experience and comes with APACHE version 2.0 . The goal of OpenLANE is to produce clean GDSII without any human intervention. OpenLANE is tuned for Skywater 130nm open-source PDK and can be used to produce hard macros and chips.
